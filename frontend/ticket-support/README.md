## What can be done in this project?

- You can create an account, log in, and log out. Each created account is automatically saved in the database with the user role.
- You can send personal details such as name, surname, identification number, age, address, phone number, form title, and content, along with attachments like PDF/JPG/PNG files. Files containing specific details, such as PDFs, JPGs, or PNGs, can only be viewed by authorized personnel. Each form you submit can be tracked with an automatically generated reference ID. If you submit a form after logging in, your username will be included in the form. You can filter through all the forms you've submitted without the need to save the reference IDs of each form separately. If you submit a form as a guest, your username will automatically be marked as 'guest', and you'll need to access your submitted forms using your reference ID.
- If logged in as a user, you can comment below your submitted form, adding additional comments about areas where you feel the description might be incomplete. Guests cannot leave comments without logging in; they are expected to log in to write comments.
- If you accidentally submit a form, you can update its status and mark it as 'Cancelled'. If your submitted form has been marked as 'Resolved' by an authorized person but you believe you havenâ€™t received the necessary response, you can edit the form, mark it as 'Waiting for response', and await a new reply. Guests cannot edit their submitted forms. Additionally, users can only edit the 'status' of their submitted form; they cannot edit other sections.
- Your personal and private information in the submitted form is only visible to authorized personnel. Other users and guests can only see general sections of your complaint, such as the subject and content, but cannot view your personal and private details.
- Forms submitted by other users and guests can be viewed by everyone. Comments made by authorized personnel can be seen, and the status of these forms being resolved or not can be checked.
- Members cannot interact with each other. Users and guests cannot access the admin panel.
- Admins can view the complete contents of all forms, including personal information. They have full authorization to edit all form details and comments, delete forms, and comments.
- The login pages for admins and regular users differ. If an admin tries to log in from the regular user login panel, they receive a warning message and are automatically redirected to the admin login panel.
- If the URL being accessed does not exist, a 404 not found error is encountered.
